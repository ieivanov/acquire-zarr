# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Load and dump stream settings from YAML/JSON config files, via `ZarrStreamSettings_load_from_*`/`_dump_to_*` (C) and
  `StreamSettings.from_file`/`from_string`/`from_dict`/`to_file`/`to_yaml`/`to_json`/`to_dict` (Python). Credentials are
  never read from config. See `examples/config/` (#236)

### Changed

- Filesystem files are now opened with `FILE_SHARE_READ` on Windows, so another process (e.g. napari) can open the
  store for reading while an acquisition is in progress (#234)

### Fixed

- Metadata (`zarr.json`) writes now truncate the file to the written length. Previously a rewrite shorter than the
  prior version (e.g. replacing a large custom-metadata blob with a smaller one) left stale trailing bytes, since
  neither the Win32 nor POSIX backend truncated on write; strict JSON parsers such as zarr-python rejected the
  result (#234)

## [0.8.1]

### Added

- `ZarrStream_close` (C): finalizes and frees a stream, returning a status code so a failed flush can be detected;
  `ZarrStream_destroy` remains as a void wrapper (#231)

### Changed

- Flush incrementally along a large intermediate dimension: when the append dimension has a chunk size of 1, chunk
  buffers are now flushed and freed one band at a time along the dimension just inside the append axis, so peak memory
  tracks a single band rather than the whole inner volume. This makes large intermediate axes (e.g. a `[t, z, y, x]`
  store with a ~62k `z`) feasible without running out of memory. `estimate_max_memory_usage` reflects the reduced bound
  (czbiohub-sf/livescreen-acquisition#210)
- Bound the frame queue to 256 MiB; `append()` now applies backpressure instead of buffering unboundedly, cutting
  peak memory ~3x at the cost of higher tail latency under sustained pressure (#230)
- Copy frames directly into chunk buffers, removing an intermediate copy (~1.3-1.9x write throughput on filesystem) (#230)
- Windows: reuse the per-handle `OVERLAPPED` event and drop the per-close `FlushFileBuffers` (#230)
- Enable AVX2 and LTO for the streaming library (#230)

### Fixed

- `estimate_max_memory_usage` now models the frame queue as the actual 256 MiB / [16, 512]-frame bound (#230) instead
  of a flat 1 GiB, so the estimate matches real peak usage
- Shard flush (`fsync`) failures are no longer swallowed in the `Shard` destructor; an I/O error now fails the
  stream instead of silently producing corrupt shards. Python `close()` raises on a failed flush (#231)

## [0.8.0] - [2026-05-29](https://github.com/acquire-project/acquire-zarr/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0)

### Added

- `max_levels` field on `ZarrArraySettings` (C API) and `ArraySettings` (Python) to cap the maximum number of
  downsampled pyramid levels; `0` means no limit (default) (#225)
- Stock Zstd compression codec support as a standalone codec without Blosc (#209)
- Dockerfile for containerized builds (#207)

### Changed

- `ZarrStream_write_custom_metadata` (C) and `stream.write_custom_metadata` (Python) signatures have changed: the
  `custom_metadata` and `overwrite` parameters have been replaced with `array_key`, `metadata_key`, and `metadata`.
  Custom metadata is now written under the `attributes` key of the target array or group's `zarr.json`, rather than
  to a sidecar `acquire.json` file (#201)
- Chunk sizes at downsampled pyramid levels are now preserved rather than clamped to the array size; a chunk larger
  than the array produces a single partial chunk, which is valid in Zarr v3 (#225)
- Restored compression/write parallelism through a refactor of the chunk and shard write paths, reducing peak memory
  usage and improving write throughput on multicore systems (#219)
- Documented `output_key` and `downsampling_method` behavior (#206)

### Fixed

- LOD1 pixel corruption when downsampling an odd-sized Z dimension and the downsampled writes crossed a shard
  boundary on the append dimension (#228)
- Frame-processing deadlock that could occur when an error was raised during processing, and a related worker-exit
  deadlock where producers could block forever on a full frame queue after the worker had returned (#216, #221, #222)
